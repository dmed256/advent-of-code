# Advent of Code - Python Edition

Written with Python 3.9, not sure if any specific minor version features are being used but throwing it out here as a heads up.

## Running test

```sh
export PYTHONPATH+=:<repo>
python <day>.py
````

For example

```sh
cd advent_of_code/python/2021

export PYTHONPATH+=:${HOME}/git/coding-puzzles
python 02.py
````
